# Configuration file template for LSVMI. Copy to an actual file, uncomment the
# optional sections as needed and set the desired values. The settings below are
# set for the default values.

# # HTTP Endpoint Pool section:
# http_endpoint_pool_config:
#   # The list of endpoint URLs. Each URL may have an associated threshold for
#   # failed accesses count, used for declaring the endpoint unhealthy; this may
#   # be > 1 for cases where the host name part of the URL is some kind of a DNS
#   # pool which is resolved to a list of addresses, in which case it should be
#   # set to the number of pool members. Just because one member is unhealthy, it
#   # doesn't mean that others cannot be used. The net/http Transport connection
#   # cache will remove the failed connection and the name to address resolution
#   # mechanism should no longer resolve to this failed IP.
#   endpoints:
#     - url: http://localhost:8428/api/v1/import/prometheus
#       mark_unhealthy_threshold: 1
#
#   # How often to rotate the healthy endpoint list, to load balance the
#   # connections; use 0 to disable. The value must be compatible with
#   # https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration
#   healthy_rotate_interval: 5m
#
#   # After what time to reset the cumulative error count of a failed endpoint.
#   # A failed endpoint is moved to the back of the usable list, as long as the
#   # cumulative error count is less than the threshold. If enough time passes
#   # before it makes it back to the head of the list, then the error count used
#   # to declare it unhealthy is no longer relevant and it should be reset. Use 0
#   # to disable. The value must be compatible with
#   # https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration
#   error_reset_interval: 1m
#
#   # How often to check if an unhealthy endpoint has become healthy. The value
#   # must be compatible with https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration and >= 1s
